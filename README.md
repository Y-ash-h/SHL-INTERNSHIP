# 🚀 SHL Internship – Gemini + OpenSearch Semantic Search System

This project was developed as part of the **SHL Internship Assessment**. It implements a powerful **semantic search system** by integrating **Google's Gemini API** with **OpenSearch**. The goal is to retrieve and answer questions based on contextually relevant chunks from uploaded documents using AI-powered embeddings.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📄 **Text Embedding**: Chunk `.txt` files and generate embeddings using Gemini.
- 🗃️ **OpenSearch Indexing**: Store and search semantic vectors efficiently.
- 🤖 **Intelligent Q&A**: Retrieve the most relevant document chunk and answer the user's question using Gemini.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SHL-INTERNSHIP.git
cd SHL-INTERNSHIP
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔐 Configuration

- Add your **Gemini API key** inside `gemini_client.py`:

```python
GeminiClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

- Ensure your **OpenSearch credentials** in `opensearch_client.py` are set as:

```python
host='localhost',
port=9200,
user='admin',
password='YourStrongPassword123!'
```

---

## 💻 How to Run

### Step 1: Start OpenSearch

Navigate to the OpenSearch folder and run:

```bash
./bin/opensearch
```

Ensure Java is installed and the port `9200` is available.

### Step 2: Embed Your Documents

Add `.txt` files to the `data/` folder, then run:

```bash
python embedded.py
```

### Step 3: Ask a Question

```bash
python question_answer.py
```

You'll be prompted to input a question, and Gemini will respond with a contextually accurate answer.

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
Enter your question: What is the purpose of SHL assessments?
Response from Gemini:
SHL assessments help employers evaluate cognitive, behavioral, and job-related traits of candidates to improve hiring decisions.
```

---

## ❗ Common Issues

- **OpenSearch not running?**  
  Make sure it's running on port `9200` and you’ve installed Java.

- **Gemini API error?**  
  Verify your API key and network access.

- **Can't upload folders to GitHub?**  
  Use Git CLI or create a `.gitkeep` file inside folders.
